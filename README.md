Systems Security Documents and Miscellaneous
============================================

This repository contains documents and miscellaneous for the Systems Security (COMSM1500) course.
After each lecture, the corresponding slide should be pushed to the repo and suggested reading material (when relevant) added.
The documents are organised by topic rather than chronologically.

You can also find the [timetable](./TimetableByWeekPDF.pdf) and the [coursework instructions](./coursework.pdf).
If you are looking for the lab sheets, they are [here](https://github.com/bris-sys-sec/labs).

If you haven't signed up to the Slack team, please read the [Slack instructions](slack.pdf) and join.
This will be used for questions, in place of the old CS Forum.
